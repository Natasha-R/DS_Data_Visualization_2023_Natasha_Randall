# Data Visualisation: Digital Sciences SS23 Final Project

This repository contains the final project of the course "Data Visualisation" (https://digital-sciences.de/en/modules/data-visualization/) for the Digital Sciences Master's Degree at TH Köln.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to investigate the differences between AI- and human-written code. The dataset was created from students’ Java code solutions to a task related to moving a robot around on a grid containing obstacles, and code solutions generated by AI chatbots (ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3, Bing Chat and Bard) to the same task. The solutions are represented as feature vectors, where a Java AST parser was used to extract the meaningful features that describe the structure of the code. The differences between the code solutions are then analysed using visualisations, in order to make the analysis more engaging and understandable.

## Project Contents

### Code

Processing the data:  
1. Download Student Code Solutions.ipynb
2. Process the Code Solutions.ipynb
3. Extract the Features.ipynb

Creating the plots:
<ol start="4">
  <li>Test Passing Plots.ipynb</li>
  <li>Single Feature Distribution Plots.ipynb</li>
  <li>Two Features Distribution Plots.ipynb</li>
  <li>Test Passing and Feature Interaction Plots.ipynb</li>
</ol>

The interactive scatterplot created in Bokeh is also released as a Python module (two_features_distribution_plot.py) so that each step can be executed individually:
```
import two_features_distribution_plot as tf_dp
data = tf_dp.format_data("processed_code_solutions/features_data.csv")
sorted_features = tf_dp.sort_features(data)
all_meshes, all_accuracy = tf_dp.create_decision_boundaries(data, sorted_features)
tf_dp.create_plot(data, all_meshes, all_accuracy, sorted_features)
```
### Data

The raw unprocessed code solutions are stored in the folder: raw_code_solutions  
The processed feature data are stored in the folder: processed_code_solutions  

### Visualisations

All of the visualisations (stored as lossless PNG files at 300dpi) can be found in the following folder: plots
